            <p>This footprint calculator is specifically designed to help you assess your environmental impact both during independent and Academic Travels. This Travel Ecological Footprint Calculator is a tool to compare travel impacts with at-home impacts. Our ecological footprint calculator is comprised of the following sub-categories: transport, accommodation, activities, goods and fiber, and food. It takes just a few minutes to calculate the total hectares (10,000 m2) of land required to absorb your equivalent carbon emissions. It is our goal to promote awareness of the environmental impacts of traveling and to foster a community of thoughtful global citizens.</p>
                <br />

            <li>Input information in the blue cells.
            (Make sure to pay attention to the units each cells asks for)</li>

            <li>The total hectare values for each category will be displayed in the green box below.</li>

            <li>After entering all information, the total hectares are displayed below. In addition, the expanded impact for the same travel habits throughout a year are displayed.</li>
    
            <li>1 hectare = 10,000m2, but to put the total hectare values into perspective, the calculator also displays the equivalent number of Franklin College grottos that would fit into your footprint.</li>
