Travel Ecological Footprint Calculator

This footprint calculator is specifically designed to help you assess your environmental
impact both during independent and Academic Travels. This Travel Ecological Footprint Calculator 
is a tool to compare travel impacts with at-home impacts. Our ecological footprint calculator 
is comprised of the following sub-categories: transport, accommodation, activities, goods and fiber,
and food. It takes just a few minutes to calculate the total hectares (10,000 m2) of land required to 
absorb your equivalent carbon emissions. It is our goal to promote awareness of the environmental impacts 
of traveling and to foster a community of thoughtful global citizens.
